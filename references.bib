season of 2003 and 2004 in the Punjab University, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan. Swarming took place on 15 out of
92 nights for which observations were made. Swarming started after 3rd rainfall of the season, which created suitable
combination of relative humidity and temperature required for swarming. Peak emergence of alates was observed after
heavy rainfall (16mm) of short duration at 25.7°C to 36°C with 100% humidity. Frequency of swarming was
maximum between 8:00 to 8:30 P.M. Overall sex ratio of H. indicola indicates that males dominate over females 5:1
(Male: Female).},

  Abstract                 = {Many complex systems can be represented and analyzed as networks, and examples that have benefited from this approach span the natural sciences. For instance, we now know that systems as disparate as the World Wide Web, the Internet, scientific collaborations, food webs, protein interactions and metabolism all have common features in their organization, the most salient of which are their scale-free connectivity distributions and their small- world behavior. The recent availability of large-scale datasets that span the proteome or metabolome of an organism have made it possible to elucidate some of the organizational principles and rules that govern their function, robustness and evolution. We expect that combining the currently separate layers of information from gene regulatory networks, signal transduction networks, protein interaction networks and metabolic networks will dramatically enhance our understanding of cellular function and dynamics. },

  Abstract                 = {Rapid, effective communication between colony members is a key attribute that enables ants to live in dominant, fiercely protected societies. Their signals, however, may be mimicked by other insects that coexist as commensals with ants or interact with them as mutualists or social parasites. We consider the role of acoustics in ant communication and its exploitation by social parasites. Social parasitism has been studied mainly in the butterfly genus Maculinea, the final instar larvae of which are host-specific parasites of Myrmica ants, preying either on ant grubs (predatory Maculinea) or being fed by trophallaxis (cuckoo Maculinea). We found similar significant differences between the stridulations of model queen and worker ant castes in both Myrmica sabuleti and Myrmica scabrinodis to that previously reported for Myrmica schencki. However, the sounds made by queens of all three Myrmica species were indistinguishable, and among workers, stridulations did not differ significantly in two of three species-pairs tested. Sounds recorded from the predatory caterpillars and pupae of Maculinea arion had similar or closer patterns to the acoustics of their host Myrmica sabuleti than those previously reported for the cuckoo Maculinea rebeli and its host Myrmica schencki, even though Maculinea rebeli caterpillars live more intimately with their host. We conclude that chemical mimicry enables Maculinea larvae to be accepted as colony members by worker ants, but that caterpillars and pupae of both predatory and cuckoo butterflies employ acoustical mimicry of queen ant calls to elevate their status towards the highest attainable position within their host's social hierarchy.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological invasions are a fixture in our landscapes, with consequent losses in endemic biota and shifts in ecosystem function. Despite the historical recognition of exotic species success in novel environs, this phenomenon lacks a holistic-descriptive framework. Recent attempts to explain biological invasions are based largely on identifying the inherent invasive qualities of successful exotic species (i.e., invasiveness), or characterizing the susceptibility of a habitat to an introduced species (i.e., invasibility), with few studies examining their interaction or additional contributing factors (e.g., time since introduction). We propose unifying the 'points of entry' into biological invasions with a state factor model that incorporates all contributing variables-not just species or habitats-into a quantifiable, factorial model amenable to hypothesis testing. State factors are phenomenological variables describing the state of a system-historically used in soil and vegetation science. Our state factor equation relates any quantifiable property of an invasion (i) as a function of propagule pressure (p), introduced habitat (h), invader autecology (a), source environment (s), and time since introduction (t). By manipulating state factors singly, or in interaction, targeted variation can be related to quantifiable properties of exotic species while controlling, or at minimum accounting for, remaining factors contributing variation to the system. This holistic factor-function paradigm extends research on invasions from beyond the limits imposed by current theory, fosters novel empirical approaches, elucidates knowledge gaps in our understanding of resident invasions, and allows for variable accounting via a factor matrix. Here we briefly outline the ontogeny of state factors in soil and vegetation science, detail our proposed 'phast' framework for biological invasions, including notation, and examine a case study in state factor utility. },

  Abstract                 = {{Question: What are the genesis and development of thicket clumps within a savanna landscape at geomorphically different locations and what are the driving forces? Location: The Kagera Region, in the border area of Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. Methods: The vegetation of 32 dry evergreen thicket clumps and their surrounding savannas have been analysed at different geomorphic locations. At each vegetation plot Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+/3+, H+, P, C, N, bulk density and particle size were determined for each soil horizon. The impact of soil and termite mounds on thicket clump dynamics on seasonally waterlogged plains, gentle slopes and stony hillsides were assessed. Results: Thicket clumps and their surrounding savannas have a distinct structure and floristic composition. They also have distinct soil properties although parent materials are the same. On seasonally waterlogged plains, new thicket clumps can develop on Macrotermitinae mounds; on stony hillsides, Trinervitermes and Macrotermes show a uniform distribution pattern and may initiate the genesis of thicket clumps. Conclusions: Geomorphology broadly determines the significance and interactions of the main factors affecting site-specific vegetation dynamics. On seasonally waterlogged plains, thicket clumps are restricted to termite mounds. Since intra-species competition dictates a minimal distance between neighbouring Macrotermitinae colonies, thicket clumps do not coalescence. By contrast, on stony hillsides, the vegetation mosaic is highly dynamic and determined by the interplay of several factors. The growth of thicket clumps is mainly a function of the fire regime and the browsing intensity. At the present time, frequent cool, early dry season fires and the near absence of large browsers have favoured the advance and coalescence of thicket clumps and forest patches on stony hillsides.}},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding why some exotic species become invasive is essential to controlling their populations. This review discusses the possibility that two mechanisms of invasion, release from natural enemies and increased resource availability, may interact. When plants invade new continents, they leave many herbivores and pathogens behind. Species most regulated by enemies in their native range have the most potential for enemy release, and enemy regulation may be strongest for high-resource species. High resource availability is associated with low defence investment, high nutritional value, high enemy damage and consequently strong enemy regulation. Therefore, invasive plant species adapted to high resource availability may also gain most from enemy release. Strong release of high-resource species would predict that: (i) both enemy release and resources may underlie plant invasion, leading to potential interactions among control measures; (ii) increases in resource availability due to disturbance or eutrophication may increase the advantage of exotic over native species; (iii) exotic species will tend to have high-resource traits relative to coexisting native species; and (iv) although high-resource plants may experience strong enemy release in ecological time, well-defended low-resource plants may have stronger evolutionary responses to the absence of enemies. },

  Abstract                 = {1. During the last decade, many studies have focused on the diversity of termite species and their ecological function, but these have been mostly based on transect protocols not designed to sample canopy-dwelling and subterranean species. Additionally, all these studies relied upon collections of foraging parties composed of workers and soldiers in the soil or in pieces of wood. 2. We hypothesised that alate-based protocols could disclose spatial and temporal patterns of termite flights and provide a more balanced picture of assemblages for ecological and biodiversity surveys. 3. Our study took place in the framework of the IBISCA-Panama project, which used numerous trapping methods to give a multifaceted overview of a complex tropical rainforest arthropod community. Two methods, flight interception traps and light traps, were efficient at collecting termite alates. All collected specimens were assigned to morphospecies which were later identified to the genus or species level, when possible. 4. Our results highlighted that: (i) alate trapping represents a powerful complement to ground-based standardised sampling protocols by allowing the documentation of the whole termite assemblage. (ii) Canopy dwellers fly preferentially in the upper strata, whereas no vertical stratification was found for ground dwellers, suggesting that height of flight is dictated by a pressure for long distance dispersal as well as the need to find a suitable site for colony-founding. (iii) Alates from closely related species do not stagger their flight period to avoid hybridisation but rather synchronise their flights according to environmental factors.},

  Abstract                 = {Nest structures of two termite species (Trinervitermes spp.) with epigeal (above-ground) mounds were analyzed to compare their nutrient status with that of adjacent soils. To take into account soil variability, the observations and samplings were made in three toposequences of different and representative West African savanna soils. The data showed the high degree of adaptation of these termite species to a large range of soil types and environments. Mounds of Trinervitermes geminatus and Trinervitermes trinervius, both grass-feeders, contained more clay, organic matter (OM), and exchangeable cations than the surrounding surface layer soil. The storage of OM and exchangeable cations was determined for T. geminatus nests and compared to the surrounding soil. Despite substantial nutrient storage in mounds, its total weight appeared low when compared to the nutrient storage in the surrounding 0-15 cm of soil surface layer. This illustrates how contradictory points of view on the use of termite mounds in agriculture need to be clarified using a classical approach that takes into account data by species; and this also evaluates the contribution of different termite mounds to nutrient fluxes and storage and the exact stocking rate of living mounds.},

and typically suffer partial or complete loss of their own brood. However, carrion crows
Corvus corone corone can benefit from parasitism by the great spotted cuckoo Clamator
glandarius. Parasitized nests have lower rates of predation-induced failure due to production
of a repellent secretion by cuckoo chicks, but among nests that are successful, those with cuckoo
chicks fledge fewer crows. The outcome of these counterbalancing effects fluctuates between
parasitism and mutualism each season, depending on the intensity of predation pressure.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of simple terms to articulate ecological concepts can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts. This problem is particularly acute in studies of nonindigenous species, which alternatively have been called 'exotic', 'introduced', 'invasive' and 'naturalised', among others. Attempts to redefine commonly used terminology have proven difficult because authors are often partial to particular definitions. In an attempt to form a consensus on invasion terminology, we synthesize an invasional framework based on current models that break the invasion process into a series of consecutive, obligatory stages. Unlike previous efforts, we propose a neutral terminology based on this framework. This 'stage-based' terminology can be used to supplement terms with ambiguous meanings (e.g. invasive, introduced, naturalized, weedy, etc.), and thereby improve clarity of future studies. This approach is based on the concept of 'propagule pressure' and has the additional benefit of identifying factors affecting the success of species at each stage. Under this framework, invasions can be more objectively understood as biogeographical, rather than taxonomic, phenomena; and author preferences in the use of existing terminology can be addressed. An example of this recommended protocol might be: 'We examined distribution data to contrast the characteristics of invasive species (stages IVa and V) and noninvasive species (stages III and IVb)'. },

  Abstract                 = {We measured the effect of a typical soil-feeding termite on soil quality using experimental mesocosms. We obtained soil from five different sites in the humid forest zone of southern Cameroon. The sites were along a disturbance gradient, from near primary, to highly degraded agricultural soil. We allowed colonies of Cubitermes fungifaber to work the soils for 13 days. We measured physical and chemical parameters in the worked soils that are known to be important in soil quality, and therefore to influence fertility. We found that C. fungifaber raised pH in soils with an initial low pH, increased organic carbon, water content and relative amount of kaolinite, and decreased the relative amount of quartz. The main effect of these termites is to raise local microsite soil quality, and these effects are greatest in the near primary and old secondary forests. Termites are, therefore, potentially important sources of heterogeneity in tropical forest soil systems.},

Australasia and sub-Saharan Africa. The ecological drivers of this distribution remain enigmatic yet
could yield insights into the evolution and persistence of cooperative breeding. We report
that the global distributions of avian obligate brood parasites and cooperatively breeding
passerines are tightly correlated and that the uneven phylogenetic distribution of cooperative
breeding is associated with the uneven targeting of hosts by brood parasites. With a long-term field
study, we show that brood parasites can acquire superior care for their young by targeting
cooperative breeders. Conversely, host defenses against brood parasites are strengthened by
helpers at the nest. Reciprocally selected interactions between brood parasites and cooperative
breeders may therefore explain the close association between these two breeding systems.},

and counteradaptations in brood parasites and hosts at all stages of the host
nesting cycle: those that precede laying of the parasitic egg and those at the
egg, chick, and fledgling stages. We then consider the factors that affect the
evolution of offense and defense portfolios (the suites of adaptations and
counteradaptations across the nesting cycle), and the outcomes of coevolu-
tionary interactions between brood parasites and hosts. Ongoing efforts to
document the diversity of host defenses and parasite offenses will facilitate
understanding of coevolutionary processes and the ecological and evolution-
ary consequences of species interactions in the natural world.},

  Abstract                 = {Macrotermes mounds are a significant feature of African woodland landscape, contributing to habitat heterogeneity The mounds are massive, often many centuries old, and support dense vegetation and a suite of woody plant species scarce in surrounding woodland. The present study tested the hypothesis that Zimbabwean Macrotermes mounds, with their greater niche availability, were more heavily utilized by small vertebrates than the surrounding miombo woodland. We carried out a survey of amphibian, reptile and mammal species during early and late rains for 16 termite mounds and 16 adjacent woodland habitat sites, and compared numbers of individuals, species and diversity. For amphibians and reptiles, individual numbers and species did not differ significantly between habitats and their activity was more influenced by season. For mammals, however, significantly more individuals and species were captured on termite mounds, with three species captured only on mounds (most notably the musk shrew Crocidura hirta spp. complex) and all others showing marked preference for this habitat. The greater number of mammals on termite mounds contributed to total small vertebrate biomass being 800 g/ha for termite mounds compared with 380 g/ha in woodland. For mammals certainly, Macrotermes mounds provide significant food and habitat in miombo woodland.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, avian brood parasites and their hosts have emerged as model systems for the study of host ^
parasite coevolution. However, empirical studies of the highly analogous social parasites, which use the
workers of another eusocial species to raise their own young, have never explicitly examined the dynamics
of these systems from a coevolutionary perspective. Here, we demonstrate interpopulational variation in
behavioural interactions between a socially parasitic slave-maker ant and its host that is consistent with
the expectations of host ^ parasite coevolution. Parasite pressure, as inferred by the size, abundance and
raiding frequency of Protomognathus americanus colonies, was highest in a New York population of the host
Leptothorax longispinosus and lowest in a West Virginia population. As host ^ parasite coevolutionary theory
would predict, we found that the slave-makers and the hosts from New York were more e¡ective at
raiding and defending against raiders, respectively, than were conspeci¢cs from the West Virginia popula-
tion. Some of these variations in e¤cacy were brought about by apparently simple shifts in behaviour.
These results demonstrate that defence mechanisms against social parasites can evolve, and they give the
¢rst indications of the existence of a coevolutionary arms race between a social parasite and its host.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolutionary interactions between permanently social parasitic species and their hosts are of special interest because social
parasites are not only closely dependent on, but are also closely related to, their hosts. The small European slavemaker
Harpagoxenus sublaevis has evolved several characters that help manipulate its host. In this study we investigated adaptations of this
social parasite to its local hosts and the geographic pattern of host resistance in two main host species from three different
populations. In behavioral experiments, we examined whether host colonies from three geographically distant Leptothorax
acervorum populations varied in their ability to defend the nest against social parasites. Naive colonies from the unparasitized
English population killed attacking slavemakers more often than did host colonies from two parasitized populations. We also
found strong interpopulation variation in the ability of the slavemaker to manipulate host behavior. H. sublaevis uses the Dufour
gland secretion to induce intracolonial fights and, in general, this ‘‘propaganda’’ substance was most effective against local hosts.
Our results suggest that the social parasite is leading the arms race in this aspect. Similar experiments uncovered differences
between two populations of the second host species L. muscorum and could demonstrate that nest defense in both host species is
similarly efficient. In L. acervorum, monogynous colonies were more successful in nest defense, whereas social structure had no
impact in L. muscorum. Colony size did not affect the efficacy of nest defense in either host species. The caste of the slavemaker
had a strong influence on the success of an attack. Key words: coevolution, geographic mosaics, host–parasite system, host
resistance, slavemaking ants, social parasites. [Behav Ecol 14:80–88 (2003)]},

  Abstract                 = {Asexuals are an important test case for theories of why species exist. If asexual clades displayed the same pattern of discrete variation as sexual clades, this would challenge the traditional view that sex is necessary for diversification into species. However, critical evidence has been lacking: all putative examples have involved organisms with recent or ongoing histories of recombination and have relied on visual interpretation of patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation rather than on formal tests of alternative evolutionary scenarios. Here we show that a classic asexual clade, the bdelloid rotifers, has diversified into distinct evolutionary species. Intensive sampling of the genus Rotaria reveals the presence of well-separated genetic clusters indicative of independent evolution. Moreover, combined genetic and morphological analyses reveal divergent selection in feeding morphology, indicative of niche divergence. Some of the morphologically coherent groups experiencing divergent selection contain several genetic clusters, in common with findings of cryptic species in sexual organisms. Our results show that the main causes of speciation in sexual organisms, population isolation and divergent selection, have the same qualitative effects in an asexual clade. The study also demonstrates how combined molecular and morphological analyses can shed new light on the evolutionary nature of species.},

In particular, systems that appear to be well modeled by such networks include World Wide Web documents, Internet routers, the cellular metabolic network, ecological food webs, social networks, and many others. The two main structures being investigated are small-world networks and scale-free networks. Three recent books, including two just published this summer, describe the research being undertaken in this burgeoning field. We survey and review these books through a discussion of the field of small-worlds research with numerous examples and considerations of the future of the field. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. },

  Abstract                 = {The termite assemblages of the Krakatau islands and five sites in Sumatra and Java were investigated, using a standardized transect sampling method. Five species were found on the Krakatau islands that have not been collected there before. The total number of termites recorded on the islands since the 1883 volcanic eruption is now twelve species, ail of which are wood feeders. No termites nesting in or feeding on the soil were found on the Krakataus, suggesting that rafting in wood is the primary method by which the termites recolonized the islands.

  Abstract                 = {The neutral model posits that random variation in extinction and speciation events, coupled with limited dispersal, can account for many community properties, including the relative abundance distribution. There are important analogies between this model in ecology and a three-tiered hierarchy of models in evolution (Hardy Weinburg, drift, drift and selection). Because it invokes random processes and is used in statistical tests of empirical data, the neutral model can be interpreted as a specialized form of a null model. However, the application and interpretation of neutral models differs from that of standard null models in three important ways: 1) whereas most null models incorporate species-level constraints that are often associated with niche differences, the neutral model assumes that all species are functionally equivalent. 2) Null models are usually fit with constraints that are measured directly from the data set itself. In contrast, the neutral model requires parameters for speciation, extinction, and migration rates that are almost never measured directly, so their values must be guessed at or fitted. 3) Most important, null models are viewed as simple statistical descriptors: unspecified "random" forces generate variation in a simple model that excludes particular biological mechanisms (usually species interactions). Although the neutral model was originally framed as a null model, recent proponents of the neutral model have begun to treat it as a literal process-based description of community assembly. These differences lie at the heart of much of the recent controversy over the neutral model. If the neutral model is truly a process-based model, then its assumptions should be directly tested, and its predictions should be compared to those of an appropriate null model. Such tests are rarely informative, and most empirical data sets can be fit more parsimoniously to a simple log-normal distribution. Because unknown parameters in the neutral model must usually be guessed at or fit in ad-hoc ways, classical frequentist tests are compromised, and may be biased towards finding a good fit with the model. There has been little analysis of the potential for type I and type II errors in statistical tests of the neutral model. The neutral model has recently been proposed as a specific form of more general null models in biogeography (the mid-domain effect) and community ecology (species co-occurrence). In both cases, the neutral model is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to the predictions of classic null models. However, because the important parameters in the neutral model can rarely be measured directly, it may be of limited value as a null hypothesis for empirical tests. Future progress may come from moving beyond dichotomous tests of neutral versus null models. Instead, the neutral model might be viewed as a mechanism that contributes to pattern along with other processes. Alternatively, the fit of data to the neutral model can be compared to the fit to other process-based models that are not based on neutrality assumptions. Finally, the neutral model can also be tested directly if its parameters can be estimated independently of the test data. However, these approaches may require more data than are often available. For these reasons, simple null model tests will continue to be important in the evaluation of the neutral model.},

The response of five strains of C. maculatus to seeds of two host species, cowpea
(Vigna unguiculata) and mung bean (Vigna radiata), was measured along with the
larval respiration rates of the same strains on both hosts. There was significant
variability of response to the two hosts. Strains with higher larval respiration rate
(mL O 2 /insect/day) showed higher seed consumption, which significantly affected
adult emergence per seed on both hosts. This finding provides support for the
hypothesis that differential feeding rate is an important mechanistic component of
the larval competition outcome observed in strains of C. maculatus.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim. The study examined qualitative predictions of ecological theories in relation to the spatial distribution of species turnover of aquatic macrophytes, through the following parameters: (1) distance between lakes (2) chemical conditions of the lakes (3) chemical differences between the lakes, and (4) the lake size. Location. 562 lakes dispersed throughout Northern Ireland were analyzed. Methods. To obtain species turnover estimates independent of richness, the average distance between focal lakes and thier five nearest neighbours in ordination space (DCA) was standardized by the species richness in a generalized Additive Model (GAM). The realtionship between species turnover and ecological (chemical condition, chemical difference, distance between lakes, and lake-size) and geographical parameters (latitude, longitude, and altitude) were analysed using GAM. Results. The results indicate that the pattern in species turnover is a combination of the chemical conditions and the distance between the lakes, including the interaction term. The effects of chemical heterogeneity and lake size parameters were both positive but weak. In general, increased distance and decreased ionic concentration contribute to increased turnover. The influence of distance on species turnover is strongest at low and high altitude, and at mid-elevation the species turnover is mainly driven by the chemical conditions. Towards the north there is an increasing influence of distance, whereas in the south the chemical conditions have their strongest influence. Conclusions. There is a need for components from several established ecological theories to explain the spatial trends in species turnover within Northern Ireland. Central theories in this particular study are the population/metapopulation dynamics, the continuum concept, and the species-pool concept. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The diversity of parasitic insects remains one of the most conspicuous patterns on the planet. The principal factor thought to
contribute to differentiation of populations and ultimately speciation is the intimate relationship parasites share with hosts and
the potential for disruptive selection associated with using different host species. Traits that generate this diversity have been an
intensely debated topic of central importance to the evolution of specialization and maintenance of ecological diversity. A funda-
mental hypothesis surrounding the evolution of specialization is that no single genotype is uniformly superior in all environments.
This “trade-off” hypothesis suggests that negative fitness correlations can lead to specialization on different hosts as alternative
stable strategies. In this study we demonstrate a trade-off in the ability of the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, to maintain a high level
of fitness on an ancestral and novel host, which suggests a genetic basis for host utilization that may limit host-range expansion
in parasitoids. Furthermore, behavioral evidence suggests mechanisms that could promote specialization through induced host
fidelity. Results are discussed in the context of host-affiliated ecological selection as a potential source driving diversification in
parasitoid communities and the influence of host species heterogeneity on population differentiation and local adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {Death feigning is fairly common in a number of taxa, but the adaptive significance of this behaviour is still unclear and has seldom been tested. To date, all proposed hypotheses have assumed that prey manage to escape predation by sending a death-mimicking signal, although death-feigning postures are markedly different from those of dead animals. Moreover, the efficacy of this technique may largely depend on the foraging mode of the predator; death feigning seldom works with sit-and-wait predators that make the decision to attack and consume prey within a very brief time. We examined whether death feigning in the pygmy grasshopper Criotettix japonicus Haan was an inducible defence behaviour against the frog Rana nigromaculata, a sit-and-wait, gape-limited predator. The characteristic posture assumed by the grasshopper during death feigning enlarges its functional body size by stretching each of three body parts (pronotum, hind legs and lateral spines) in three different directions, thereby making it difficult for the predator to swallow the prey. Our result is the first consistent explanation for why death-mimicking animals do not always mimic the posture of dead animals. },

  Abstract                 = {1. Stable nitrogen (N) isotope has been widely used to disentangle food webs and to infer trophic positions of organisms based on an assumption that the stepwise enrichment occurs along trophic levels. The enrichment of N-15 in soil organisms with diet humification has also been reported, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully examined. 2. To examine the effect of diet humification on N-15, we estimated the stable N isotope ratios and diet ages of earthworms and termites. These organisms feed on organic matter with various degrees of humification, ranging from undecomposed plant materials to humified organic matter (soil organic matter), in a gallery forest and a savanna in the Ivory Coast. We defined diet age as the time elapsed since carbon (C) in the diet of earthworms and termites was fixed from atmospheric CO2 by photosynthesis; it was estimated by comparing the radiocarbon (C-14) content of these organisms to atmospheric (CO2)-C-14 records. 3. Stable N isotope ratios increased along the humification gradient of diets, and values for earthworms and termites varied from 1.8 parts per thousand to 9.9 parts per thousand and from -1.5 parts per thousand to 15.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Epigeic (litter-feeding) earthworms had younger diet ages (2-4 years), whereas endogeic (soil-feeding) earthworms generally exhibited older diet ages (5-9 years). Grass-feeding termites had young diet ages (2 years), and wood/soil-feeding termites had the oldest diet ages (c. 50 years). Soil-feeding termites were similar in diet age (7-12 years) to wood feeders (8-11 years), with the exception of one species (18-21 years) that consumes large-diameter wood. 4. A significant positive relationship was found between diet ages and stable N isotope ratios of the two groups in the savanna. This relationship held in the gallery forest when termites feeding on woody tissues were not considered. These results show that the stable N isotope ratios of organisms can increase with diet age, unless C in the diet has been stored as organic matter, such as woody tissue, that is able to age without being subject to humification processes. 5. Given that above-ground food webs are often sustained directly by material and energy flow from below-ground food webs, in addition to trophic interactions, gradual enrichment of N-15 with the humification of below-ground diets should be considered when interpreting stable N isotope ratios of terrestrial food webs. },

  Abstract                 = {There are numerous reports on the accumulation of ammonia in the mounds of soil-feeding termites. Here, we provided direct evidence for an effective mineralization of nitrogenous soil organic matter in the gut of Cubitermes spp., which gives rise to enormous ammonia concentrations in the intestinal tract. In Cubitermes ugandensis, the ammonia content of the nest material [24.5 mu mol (g dry wt.)(-1)] was about 300-fold higher than that of the parent soil. Large amounts of ammonia were present throughout the intestinal tract, with lowest values in the extremely alkaline gut sections (pH > 12) and highest values posterior hindgut [185 mu mol (g dry wt.)(-1)]. Results obtained with other Cubitermes species were similar. Ammonia concentrations in the posterior hindgut of these humivorous species (up to 130 mM) are among the highest values ever reported for soil macroinvertebrates and are matched only by insects feeding on an extremely protein-rich diet (e.g., the sarcophageous larvae of blowflies). Volatilization of ammonia [about 10 nmol (g fresh wt.)(-1) h(-1)], either directly by emission from the termite body or indirectly from their feces, led to NH3 concentrations in the nest atmosphere of C. ugandensis that were three orders of magnitude above the ambient background - a relative accumulation that is considerably higher than that observed with CH4 and CO2. Together with previous results, these observations document that through their feeding activity and due to the physicochemical and biochemical properties of their digestive system, soil-feeding termites effectively catalyze the transformation of refractory soil organic nitrogen to a plant-available form that is protected from leaching by adsorption to the nest soil. Nitrogen mineralization rates of soil-feeding termites may surpass those effected by tropical earthworms and should contribute significantly to nitrogen fluxes in tropical ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil-feeding termites transport soil for mound building, and this process can affect soil characteristics. To verify the influence of soil termite activity on soil characteristics, samples were collected from top, bottom and center of termite mounds, and of the adjacent area, to assess chemical and physical properties and mineralogical composition. Four replicates of termite mounds and respective adjacent areas were randomly sampled in Lages, Capao Alto, Painel, Sao Jose do Cerrito and Coxilha Rica (State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil). Results of chemical analyses showed a greater content of K, P, Ca, Mg and organic C in the inner part of termite mounds, accompanied by lower pH in relation to soil of the adjacent area. There were no differences regarding clay mineral composition between termite mounds and adjacent soil, however the proportion of sand and clay differed between them. It is concluded that termites modify soil characteristics due to great volume of soil transported per ascensum for mound construction (varying from 20.9 m(3) ha(-1) to 136.6 m(3) ha(-1), in this Study) which promotes a strong pedo-bioperturbation and affects nutrient cycling and soil physical properties.},

  Abstract                 = {1. In the size-grain hypothesis (a) long legs allow walking organisms to step over gaps and pores in substrate but prohibit them from entering those gaps; (b) the world is more rugose for small organisms; and (c) the relative cost of long legs increases as organisms grow smaller. The hypothesis predicts a positive allometry of leg length ( = mass(b) where b > 0.33 of isometry), a pattern that robustly holds for ants. 2. Toward testing for leg length allometries in other taxa, arthropods were extracted from the Panama leaf litter and measured. Three common taxa (spiders, diplopods, Coleoptera) yielded bs that exceeded 0.33 while three others (Acarina, Pseudoscorpiones, and Collembola) did not. The exponent b tended to increase (P = 0.06, n = 7) with an arthropod taxon's average body mass. 3. Since leg length in cursorial organisms tends toward isometry in very small and very large taxa (i.e. mammals) this suggests that the size-grain hypothesis may best apply at a transition zone of intermediate body mass: the macroarthropods. 4. Body length was a robust predictor of mass in all groups despite variation in shape. },

Even more surprising was the discovery that power-law distributions also characterize many biological and social networks. Many attributed a deep significance to this fact, inferring a "universal architecture" of complex systems. Closer examination, however, challenges the assumptions that (1) such distributions are special and (2) they signify a common architecture, in- dependent of the system's specifics. The real surprise, if any, is that power-law distributions are easy to generate, and by a variety of mechanisms. The architecture that results is not universal, but particular; it is determined by the actual constraints on the system in question. },

  Abstract                 = {The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current understanding about this concept. We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone. },

  Abstract                 = {A year-long Field experiment showed that Reticulitermes flavipes attacked and used single stakes and wooden stake bundles differently in two habitats that varied in alternative forage. In both habitats, the number of termites present in single stakes and stake-bundles increased with stake resource size, and the number of larvae recorded from feeding sites was a close reflection of the number of workers attracted to a given food source. Over 12 mo, more single stakes and stake bundles were heavily attacked and abandoned in the pine woods compared with grassy clearings. Paradoxically, the number of termites present in single stakes and stake bundles was greater in the food-poor habitat (grassy clearings), yet the wood was less consumed compared with the food-rich habitat (pine woods). Use of stake bundles as nests and the slower rate of wood consumption in grassy clearings indicated that termites seemed to value food resources in relative terms, i.e., those termites with abundant alternative food resources consumed quickly and departed, whereas those lacking extra resources ate slowly and settled in. These field results confirm earlier laboratory results that showed that termites modified wood consumption rates dependent oil the amount of food available to the colon),,is a whole. The appearance of mature (physogastric) reproductives (>> 1 yr old) in stake bundles in both habitats further indicated that termites track resources and opportunistically shift colony activities and possibly territory boundaries depending oil the nature of the resources and other environmental factors. Implications for managing termites with a baiting strategy are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Nest structures of six termite species, four with epigeous (above-ground) and two with subterranean nests were analysed to find out how their building and feeding habits could be related to their nests phosphorus status compared with control soils. Termite nest structure was found to affect significantly the P status in savanna soils: mounds of the African Trinervitermes geminatus and the South American Nasutitermes ephratae (both grass-feeders) displayed a greater amount of available P, especially in the inner part of the nest, than the surrounding soil. The abundant quantities of dead grass material stored in the mound can explain the available soil P increase. A similar increase in P availability was also found for the soil-feeder Cubitermes severus. In mounds of Macrotermes bellicosus, on the other hand, there was a drastic increase in P sorption (and a corresponding decrease in available P) compared to adjacent soils, which was attributed to the building strategy of this species. M. bellicosus selected clay from subsoil to build its nest structure. The data obtained for the subterranean species Ancistrotermes cavithorax and Microtermes toumodiensis indicated also that there is an increase in P sorption in mounds when compared with associated topsoils. Consequently, the nest structures of only certain termite species should be considered, and utilised, as a soil amendment in place of fertilisers. This impact on the P cycle in savannas seems to be related to the termite feeding status and to the type of material utilised in nest building. This should be taken into account before using termite nest material in soil fertility status improvement.},

  Abstract                 = {1. For plant invaders, being different is often equated with being successful, yet the mechanistic connection remains unclear. 2. Classic niche theory predicts that invaders with niches distinct from the native flora should coexist with little interaction with native species, yet such invaders often have substantial impacts. Meanwhile, invaders that overlap in niche space with native species should either be repelled or dominate, yet these invaders often naturalize with little effect. Such discrepancies between theory and observation raise questions about how species differences influence invader establishment and impact. 3. Here, we review these issues in light of recent work on coexistence theory, which shows how niche and fitness differences between natives and invaders interact to determine invasion outcomes. We show how successful invader establishment depends on either a fitness advantage or niche difference from resident species, but that only the former allows invaders to become dominant. 4. By identifying the role of niche and fitness differences in leading invasion hypotheses, we unify their predictions for invasion success while highlighting new approaches for evaluating the importance of species differences for invasion. 5. Synthesis. Situating the invasion process within a recent coexistence framework broadens our understanding of invasion mechanisms and more tightly links problems in invasion ecology with our more general understanding of community dynamics. },

  Abstract                 = {Migration is a key process for spatially structured populations. We examined how a variety of patch based metrics commonly used to predict the number of immigrants to a habitat patch performed based on data from three different years, in two distinct insect systems. The first system was an herbivorous beetle inhabiting patches of its host plant within a 'typical' patch network. In this system there were numerous patches located relatively close to one another, given the beetle's dispersal ability. The second system consisted of a butterfly inhabiting a series of 17 subalpine meadows. Here, the patches were arranged in a linear fashion and were more distant from each other. Overall, we found that the best models incorporating aspects of patch size and/or isolation explained a large (30-40%) amount of deviance in immigration, but there were considerable differences between the systems. For the first system, we found that metrics including the size of the target patch explained the highest proportion of deviance in immigrant numbers, while metrics based only on interpatch distances explained very little deviance. The situation was reversed for the second system. Metrics including the size of the target patch explained little deviance, while metrics based on the distance between patches explained the bulk of deviance in the number of immigrants. The results of our study show that the effects of patch size and isolation on the number of immigrants are highly important, but dependent on spatial scale, the organism studied, and how it responds to the spatial arrangement of patches. Correspondingly, there will be no single generalized metric to predict immigration for all cases. Given the dependency of the results on the system studied, we recommend that future studies provide explicit data on habitat areas and dispersal distance relative to interpatch distance to allow for meaningful comparison among organisms and systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Very little is known about reproductive strategies of the termites, and those that have been described refer to non-Brazilian species. This study was designed to enhance the knowledge concerning the reproductive strategies of the species Cortaritermes fulviceps (Silvestri) which is common in Rio Grande do Sul. From October 2002 to December 2004, laboratory tests with sexual alates, soldiers, and workers of C. fulviceps were performed. Three series of tests were made with the individuals of colonies collected at Praia Grande beach (29 degrees 20'S; 49 degrees 43'W) and in Torres, northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul State. Tests with seven individual combinations were applied in order to answer the following questions: can C. fulviceps reproduction happen without previous swarming? If there are any males, does C. fulviceps show facultative reproductive strategies? Which combinations of individuals can produce a new colony? Five combinations (an alate couple; an alate female and adealate male; two alate females; four alate females; an alate female and one soldier) produced new colonies. The combination of four alate females had the higher mean reproductive success (4.86%) in a shorter time (42 days), until workers started to appear. These results suggested that C. fulviceps presents facultative reproductive strategies which could augment or ensure the species success when the environmental conditions are critical or stressing. },

  Abstract                 = {Dispersal flights of termites are the result of the sum of a number of complex and highly
orchestrated behavioural responses by different castes to a variety of cues. Macrotermes
natalensis (Haviland) produced a single brood of alates each year. These alates left their
parent nests in dispersal flights early in the summer rainy season from late September to
early December, with a peak during October. Rainfall was the primary stimulatory factor
triggering flight; 5 mm was the threshold for initial flights. Large flights usually occurred
later in the season and required more rain to trigger them. The initiation and duration of
individual flights were regulated by factors such as temperature, light intensity, and wind.
The threshold temperature for swarming flights lay between 17–19°C. If the air temperature
dropped below this the flight was aborted. The species did not fly during rain and major
flights took place between 39 % and 90 % relative humidity. Windless conditions were
favoured for flight which ensured that alates were not distributed so widely that the chances
of finding a mate were jeopardized and that the female sex pheromone was not so dispersed
that males failed to locate mates. Flight times varied over the flight season as they were
governed by light intensity and took place at dusk in low light intensities with alates leaving
the nest from 1 to 30 lux. The majority of swarming flights occurred with a waxing moon.},

  Abstract                 = {Flight activities of two sympatric termite species, Macrotermes gilvus (Hagen) and Macrotermes carbonarius (Hagen), were studied in Penang Island, Malaysia. Herein, we present the first documentation of chronological reproductive isolation of M. gilvus and M. carbonarius. Flights of M. gilvus were recorded over a remarkably long 7-mo period from March to September, whereas swarming of M. carbonarius took place from November to January. Swarming events of AT. gilvus and M. carbonarius occurred under atmospheric pressures of 1,005-1,011 and 1,006-1,010 hPa, respectively. Most flights of M. gilvus occurred on days with rain, whereas M carbonarius avoided rain. Flight activity of M. gilvus was correlated significantly with atmospheric pressure and rainfall. The threshold temperature and relative humidity of M. gilvus flights were between 23 and 26 degrees C and 83 and 98% RH, respectively; M. carbonarius swarmed between 25 and 30 degrees C and 72 and 83% R-H, respectively. The flight activity of M. gilvus concentrated in the warmer and humid months with a monthly total rainfall of 228 mm. Both species swarmed at distinct times of day during the limited field observations: Flights of M. gilvus began between 0300 and 0430 hours (light intensity <1 Lx), and flights of M. carbonarius lasted for only 4-10 min between 1900 mid 1910 hours (at dusk; light intensity: 20-200 Lx). Windless conditions were preferred for the flights of both species.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a simple analytical model to investigate the conditions for the evolution of obligate interspecific brood parasitism in birds, based on clutch size optimization, when birds can lay more eggs than their optimal clutch size. The results show that once intraspecific parasitism has appeared (i.e., females start to spread their eggs over their own and other nests) the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest decreases. Two possible ESSs exist: (1) either the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest is larger than zero, and a fraction of the total number of eggs is laid parasitically (i.e., intraspecific parasitism); and (2) either the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest is zero and all eggs are laid parasitically Since all females lay parasitically, this could favor the evolution of obligate interspecific brood parasitism. The key parameter allowing the shift from intraspecific to obligate interspecific parasitism is the intensity of density-dependent mortality within broods (i.e., nestling competition). Strong nestling competition, as in altricial species, can lead to an ESS where all eggs are laid parasitically: Altricial species are, therefore, predicted to evolve more easily toward obligate interspecific parasitism than precocial species. These predictions fit the observed distribution of brood parasitism in birds, where only one species out of 95 obligate interspecific parasites exhibits a precocial mode of development. Different nestling survival functions provided similar findings (i.e., obligate brood parasitism is more likely to evolve in altricial species), suggesting that these results are robust with respect to the main assumption of the model. },

  Abstract                 = {Few studies have investigated the use of termitaria by nesting parrots, or how this may be affected by habitat transformation. We determined selection of termitaria by nesting Orange-fronted Parakeets Aratinga canicularis, and evaluated the effect of habitat transformation on the availability of termitaria nest-sites for Parakeets in the tropical dry forest of Western Mexico. Availability of termitaria was quantified in 24 survey plots in a factorial design of six 1-ha plots in each of conserved and modified, deciduous and semi-deciduous forest. Characteristics of termitaria were determined in survey plots, as well as 21 nest-termitaria used by Parakeets, and their nearest adjacent termitarium. There was an overall density of 1.6 termitaria/ha suitable for nesting by Parakeets, which did not differ between habitats, although only 8% of apparently suitable termitaria were occupied by nesting Parakeets. However, termitaria in conserved semi-deciduous forest were significantly higher above the ground, and termitaria in conserved deciduous forest were significantly smaller in volume. In the modified landscape, termitaria were significantly lower and their volume significantly larger than in conserved landscapes. Termitaria used by nesting parrots were at a significantly greater height above the ground than the nearest adjacent termitaria. Termitarium volume did not reliably predict the likelihood of nest-site selection, although Parakeets only used termitaria between 15 and 150 l. Parakeets nesting in modified habitats used termitaria at a significantly lower height than Parakeets nesting in conserved habitat. It is unclear whether this represents a decline in nest-site quality in modified habitats, which could affect reproductive success of Parakeet populations in fragmented landscapes.},

  Abstract                 = {The abundance of termites in many habitats, in particular tropical forests, makes them a valuable source of food for potential predators. Termites have developed a complex system of colony defence that includes the nest, and worker and soldier castes. A classification exists for the mechanical types of soldier defence, which is based on the relationship between morphology and function. This study re-examines the classification system using extended eigenshape analysis as an outline-based morphometric technique. Separate analyses were conducted on the major soldier defence structures: mandibles, head capsule and labrum. Varied support for the defence groups in these structures was demonstrated. Only glue-squirting Nasutitermitinae and asymmetrical snapping mandibles in Termitinae were strongly supported by a selection of head features and had little overlap with the remaining groups. The morphometric descriptions of shape were mapped onto a recent Isopteran phylogeny, and nodal head shapes modelled to examine the evolution of soldier head morphology. Little structural change was observed in the basal nodes and lineages. In contrast, morphological diversification has occurred within the Termitinae subfamily, with several instances of convergent evolution of particular characters, e.g. extended nasus, and mandibles shaped specifically for snapping and piercing.

  Abstract                 = {Community ecology theory can be used to understand biological invasions by applying recent niche concepts to alien species and the communities that they invade. These ideas lead to the concept of 'niche opportunity' which defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space. Niche opportunities vary naturally between communities but might be greatly increased by disruption of communities, especially if the original community members are less well adapted to the new conditions. Recent niche theory clarifies the prediction that low niche opportunities (invasion resistance) result from high species diversity. Conflicting empirical patterns of invasion resistance are potentially explained by covarying external factors. These various ideas derived from community ecology provide a predictive framework for invasion ecology. },

  Abstract                 = {Movement and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) release of individual Formosan, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and Eastern, Reticulitermes
flavipes (Kollar) subterranean termites were recorded simultaneously in real time. Worker, soldier, and pre-alate (nymph) caste
termites were recorded over 1-h periods at ambient temperature and normoxia in dry, CO 2 -free air. No evidence of discontinuous
gas exchange cycles (DGCs) was observed in 344 recordings. Intensity of movement was constant in video tape recordings of
termites under respirometry conditions. Duration of movement did not have a significant effect on residuals of V ̇ CO 2 regressed on
mass. Thus, movement did not effect V ̇ CO 2 for these two species. Overall CO 2 release values were calculated for all recordings
resulting in mean V ̇ CO 2 (ml CO 2 g Ϫ1 h Ϫ1 ), and compared among caste, colony, and species with a nested ANOVA. There was
significant interaction (P=0.0161) only for species. Mean CO 2 release was significantly greater for R. flavipes (0.507 ml CO 2 g Ϫ1
h Ϫ1 ) than C. formosanus (0.310 ml CO 2 g Ϫ1 h Ϫ1 ). Mass scaling of termite V ̇ CO 2 was investigated by regressing log 10 V ̇ CO 2 on
log 10 mass. The overall model combining species gave a mass scaling coefficient of 0.861(±0.0791), which approximates a previously
published value for the arthropods as a whole (0.825).},

  Abstract                 = {Many factors contribute to the success of a socially parasitic strategy, especially the ability of the parasite to invade a host colony. However, little research has focused on the choices that may be made by an invading parasite, specifically whether parasites actively discriminate between different host colonies and if they have a preference for colonies of a particular size. When an allodapine social parasite, Inquilina schwarzi, was presented with colonies of their host species, Exoneura robusta, the parasites were found to invade the larger host colonies. However, it could not be ascertained from this study whether the parasites were making an active decision concerning which colony to invade, or whether they were simply more attracted to the larger colonies due to potentially stronger odour cues. Regardless of the cause, the larger host colonies are more at risk of being invaded by a social parasite, which would give parasites greater resources for exploitation and could also provide selection against the large host colony sizes.},

These studies combine the microcosm advantages of small size, short generation times, contained structure and hierarchical spatial arrangement with advantages of field studies: natural environmental variance, 'openness' and realistic species combinations with shared evolutionary histories. This enables tests of theory pertaining to spatial and temporal dynamics, for example, the effects of neighboring communities on local diversity, or the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function. Using examples, we comment on the position of natural microcosms in the roster of ecological research strategies and tools. We conclude that natural microcosms are as versatile as artificial microcosms, but as complex and biologically realistic as other natural systems. Research to date combined with inherent attributes of natural microcosms make them strong candidate model systems for ecology.},

  Abstract                 = {The intestinal flagellates of termites produce cellulases that contribute to cellulose digestion of their host termites. However, 75% of all termite species do not harbour the cellulolytic flagellates; the endogenous cellulase secreted from the midgut tissue has been considered a sole source of cellulases in these termites. Using the xylophagous flagellate-free termites Nasutitermes takasagoensis and Nasutitermes walkeri, we successfully solubilized cellulases present in the hindgut pellets. Zymograms showed that the hindguts of these termites possessed several cellulases and contained up to 59% cellulase activity against crystalline cellulose when compared with the midgut. Antibiotic treatment administered to N. takasagoensis significantly reduced cellulase activity in the hindgut, suggesting that these cellulases were produced by symbiotic bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {The many qualifying terms attributed to invasive species reveal the lack of precision surrounding the notion of biological invasion itself. In spite of several proposed definitions, some basic disagreements persist concerning characterization of the phenomenon. These primarily arise from the lack of pertinence of both of the main current criteria-the geographic (or biogeographic) criterion and the impact criterion-to what is really intended by "invasion." Faced with this situation, it seems preferable to adopt an ontological approach allowing a return to the basic principles of the elaboration of a definition. Starting with the nature of the phenomenon itself (i.e., its essence), we try to elucidate the notion of biological invasion and we suggest a general definition compatible with most of the ideas already expressed. },

  Abstract                 = {The probability that obligate interspecific brood parasitism (OP), among altricial birds evolved directly from the normal breeding (no parasitism, NP) mode Or indirectly through intraspecific nest parasitism (INP) was examined by using maximum-likelihood and parsimony approaches. We examined the probability of ancestral states at 24 key nodes in order to test our hypotheses. The state of die most basal node in a tree of 565 genera of altricial birds is equivocal; however, the state probability of NP at this node is about 5.5-fold more likely than the state of obligate parasite. A similar trend was observed for basal nodes of most families examined. The INP state was Supported only in the Hirundinidae. The high incidence of INP among martins and swallows explains this finding. Contrary to Our predictions, even in other groups where there is a high incidence of INP and OP, Such as in the tribe Icteri and the Old World finches, the probability of NP being ancestral was very high. We conclude that in all cases but. one (Hirundinidae) obligate, and probably facultative, brood parasitism evolved directly from normal breeding mode rather than indirectly through some other form of parasitism. },
